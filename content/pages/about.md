        name: Lyndsay Hawkins
        title: COO
        bio: >
          Lyndsay is often described as empath who has always been fascinated by
          people — what drives them, how they grow, and how they connect. She
          started her career in recruiting, where she quickly learned that
          finding the right match wasn’t just about skills on a résumé, but
          about building trust and relationships that last.\

          \


          Over more than a decade in government contracting, Lyndsay has worn
          many hats — from technical recruiter to executive search leader to
          recruitment manager — always with the same throughline: a passion for
          people and their success. Along the way, she’s been influenced by
          incredible leaders who showed her what it means to listen deeply, lead
          with empathy, and help others shine.\

          \


          Today, as COO, Lyndsay brings all of those lessons forward. She blends
          operational know-how with a people-first mindset, building an
          organization where relationships come first and both individuals and
          the company thrive.

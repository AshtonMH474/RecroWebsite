        name: Robert Lataille
        title: Founder & CEO
        bio: >
          Robert Lataille is often described as a straight-talking builder who’s
          always been fascinated by how organizations turn messy signals into
          decisive action. Early in his career as a consultant within the
          intelligence community, he saw a persistent gap in how cybersecurity
          data was being leveraged—and leaned into big-data analytics to turn
          complexity into clarity.


          Over more than a decade serving national-security missions, Robert has
          worn many hats—from mission consultant to program lead to
          data-strategy advisor—always with the same throughline: telling the
          truth plainly, building high-trust teams, and translating cyber
          telemetry into mission outcomes. With a business foundation from
          Georgetown University, he pairs commercial rigor with an operator’s
          urgency, pushing for solutions that work in the real world.


          Today, as CEO, Robert brings that bias for candor and outcomes to
          Recro. He sets the vision, cultivates a culture of accountability, and
          focuses the company on two things: deploying elite technical experts
          against the government’s hardest problems, and helping cutting-edge
          startups enter the federal space with the guidance, support, and
          services they need to deliver successfully.

        name: Johnathan America
        title: Founder & President
        bio: >
          By 2018, government contracting was stuck in the past. Too many
          contractors hid behind compliance checklists, slowed by bureaucracy
          and outdated technology. Talented engineers felt like cogs in a
          machine, procurement cycles dragged on for years, and agencies
          collected mountains of data without turning it into actionable
          insight. Cyber security, despite its mission critical importance, was
          often treated as a box to check rather than a driving force for real
          decisions. \

          \

          I saw this firsthand early in my career. While serving as a cyber
          engineer on key projects, I was part of an IRAD initiative that
          leveraged open source intelligence (OSINT) to empower decision makers
          in groundbreaking ways. At the same time, my day-to-day mission was to
          ensure 24/7 availability, integrity, and confidentiality so our
          warfighters could operate freely and safely. That experience showed me
          the power of data driven decision making in cyber, a field that had
          long been passive and compliance focused, blind to its direct impact
          on those defending our freedoms.\

          \

          The turning point came when I asked the CISO of a three letter agency
          a simple question: “When was the last time a cybersecurity concern
          delayed a satellite launch?” His answer, “Never,” was a revelation. If
          critical vulnerabilities were not enough to pause a launch, something
          was deeply wrong with the way our industry valued cyber hygiene. At
          the same time, I saw procurement processes stall for months, brilliant
          engineers leave out of frustration, and critical programs delayed
          because of outdated tools and entrenched bureaucracy. It became clear
          that if I wanted to see meaningful change, I would have to build it
          myself.\

          \

          I had always promised myself I would start a company before turning
          30. At 29, I was climbing the career ladder quickly, but instead of
          taking lucrative offers, I chose the harder path. I teamed up with Rob
          Lataille, a trusted colleague from our days pioneering the agency’s
          first data science project for the CISO, a project that evolved from
          data science to machine learning and ultimately to AI. Rob brought an
          MBA, financial acumen, and a natural drive to move fast. I brought
          deep technical expertise and a relentless focus on quality. Together,
          we balanced speed and precision, business strategy, and cyber rigor.\

          \

          To make our vision real, we self funded the company from day one. We
          moved in together, shared a commute, and cut our salaries to the bare
          minimum to avoid outside capital or loans, an intentional choice to
          stay mission first and independent. Our CPA, attorney, friends, and
          even family told us we were crazy. They warned us the industry was
          saturated, that services companies could not stand out without a
          product, and that refusing outside financing was reckless. But we
          believed that independence was the only way to build something
          better.\

          \

          Our mission was simple but bold: deliver the most effective, data
          driven cyber solutions to government customers, faster and with
          greater impact than anyone else. Early on, we proved the skeptics
          wrong by developing and implementing the agency’s first ever
          enterprise risk assessment, a project the customer initially thought
          was impossible. We delivered it on an aggressive timeline, using
          creative approaches like adapting Google’s PageRank algorithm to
          identify the most critical devices on the network. The result was a
          revolutionary, data driven roadmap that helped the customer make
          strategic decisions and dramatically improve cyber hygiene across the
          enterprise.\

          \

          Today, we have survived government shutdowns, COVID, and the financial
          turbulence of recent years. From two founders living lean to a team of
          70 mission focused employees, our company stands as proof that a
          small, agile team founded on independence, data, and cyber expertise
          can out innovate and outperform the biggest names in government
          contracting. We built this company to be the partner we wished we had:
          mission focused, data driven, and fearless about challenging the
          status quo.

        name: Lyndsay Hawkins
        title: COO
        bio: >
          Lyndsay is often described as empath who has always been fascinated by
          people — what drives them, how they grow, and how they connect. She
          started her career in recruiting, where she quickly learned that
          finding the right match wasn’t just about skills on a résumé, but
          about building trust and relationships that last.\

          \

          Over more than a decade in government contracting, Lyndsay has worn
          many hats — from technical recruiter to executive search leader to
          recruitment manager — always with the same throughline: a passion for
          people and their success. Along the way, she’s been influenced by
          incredible leaders who showed her what it means to listen deeply, lead
          with empathy, and help others shine.\

          \

          Today, as COO, Lyndsay brings all of those lessons forward. She blends
          operational know-how with a people-first mindset, building an
          organization where relationships come first and both individuals and
          the company thrive.

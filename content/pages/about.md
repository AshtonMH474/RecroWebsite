        name: Robert Lataille
        title: Founder & CEO
        bio: >
          Robert Lataille is often described as a straight-talking builder who’s
          always been fascinated by how organizations turn messy signals into
          decisive action. Early in his career as a consultant within the
          intelligence community, he saw a persistent gap in how cybersecurity
          data was being leveraged—and leaned into big-data analytics to turn
          complexity into clarity.


          Over more than a decade serving national-security missions, Robert has
          worn many hats—from mission consultant to program lead to
          data-strategy advisor—always with the same throughline: telling the
          truth plainly, building high-trust teams, and translating cyber
          telemetry into mission outcomes. With a business foundation from
          Georgetown University, he pairs commercial rigor with an operator’s
          urgency, pushing for solutions that work in the real world.


          Today, as CEO, Robert brings that bias for candor and outcomes to
          Recro. He sets the vision, cultivates a culture of accountability, and
          focuses the company on two things: deploying elite technical experts
          against the government’s hardest problems, and helping cutting-edge
          startups enter the federal space with the guidance, support, and
          services they need to deliver successfully.

        name: Johnathan America
        title: Founder & President
        bio: >
          John America is often described as a calm, technical leader who makes
          complex ideas feel simple. As a consultant inside the intelligence
          community, he saw the same gap in cybersecurity—vast data, underused
          insight—and built analytics approaches that surfaced what mattered.
          He’s known for translating depth into clarity and ensuring the message
          lands.


          Across more than a decade, John has moved through roles spanning
          systems engineering, solutions architecture, and growth leadership.
          The throughline is steady: listen deeply, design scalable platforms,
          earn trust by delivering. With a master’s from George Mason
          University, he bridges engineers and executives, connecting technical
          truth to mission need.


          Today, as Chief Growth Officer, John brings a builder’s mindset to
          growth. He forges partnerships, shapes solutions that fit the mission,
          and ensures customers hear both the “why” and the “how.” At Recro, he
          champions two priorities: placing world-class experts on the
          government’s toughest problems, and guiding innovative startups into
          the federal market with the support and services required to succeed.

        name: Lyndsay Hawkins
        title: COO
        bio: >
          Lyndsay is often described as empath who has always been fascinated by
          people — what drives them, how they grow, and how they connect. She
          started her career in recruiting, where she quickly learned that
          finding the right match wasn’t just about skills on a résumé, but
          about building trust and relationships that last.\

          \

          Over more than a decade in government contracting, Lyndsay has worn
          many hats — from technical recruiter to executive search leader to
          recruitment manager — always with the same throughline: a passion for
          people and their success. Along the way, she’s been influenced by
          incredible leaders who showed her what it means to listen deeply, lead
          with empathy, and help others shine.\

          \

          Today, as COO, Lyndsay brings all of those lessons forward. She blends
          operational know-how with a people-first mindset, building an
          organization where relationships come first and both individuals and
          the company thrive.

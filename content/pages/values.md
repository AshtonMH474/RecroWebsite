        quote: >
          Everywhere I've ever worked, I've tried to always give my best and
          make the job better. Since working here I've seen a side of the
          workforce that I've never seen before - one where your supervisor
          values your voice, opinion, and work ethic, which in turn, makes this
          job (and going to work) a lot better. Seeing a company actually care
          about its employees and team members is something I've never
          experienced. Since being with Recro, I've transitioned from entry
          level Enterprise IT Support, to the Assistant Lead of the IT Support
          Desk Division. On top of that, Recro saw promise in me and asked me to
          be a Team Lead overseeing the personnel on my contract, which has made
          my connection with this company and team even stronger. \

          \

          This is an environment where you feel backed to the fullest. There is
          never a time where you are not heard and opinions and thoughts are not
          valued. At Recro, you are not just a number and there is an immense
          amount of effort made to feel like you are a part of a greater team.
          You become a valued team member. Recro recognizes their employees for
          helping the company grow and last year I was the Referral Raffle
          winner. Recro sent me and my family to Cancun for a full week to the
          Nickelodeon Resort - all expenses paid. They gave my family and I a
          memory we will always cherish. Recro takes care of its people. Recro
          also recognizes the need for not only personal but professional growth
          as well and I am taking the next steps in that growth, with their
          support to become a Salesforce Developer. Recro has a great job
          advancement process and are constantly encouraging us to strive for
          new and better heights in our careers. Once you join the team you will
          never want to be on another team again.

          Working with Recro has been a rewarding experience. In the world of
          contract work, it’s rare to feel like a true member of a team but
          Recro has built exactly that kind of environment. The company fosters
          connection across all levels, encouraging open communication,
          teamwork, and genuine camaraderie.\

          \

          One of the most unique opportunities I’ve had here is meeting
          regularly with a mentor who helps me align my long-term goals with the
          strides I’m making today. These conversations have guided me in
          exploring new areas of cybersecurity and gaining insight from someone
          with years of valuable experience. \

          \

          At Recro, I’ve been empowered to pursue professional development,
          explore new technologies, and deepen my understanding of space
          systems. It’s a place where growth is encouraged, collaboration is
          natural, and you’re truly supported in building your career.

          Jenna Patton reached out to me about this job. I was hesitant at
          first, but now I am glad I accepted the job offer. It has been nothing
          but a wonderful experience since I joined Recro. I feel like I am part
          of a big family. My first day was a little rough but, they made sure I
          had everything I needed for a smooth start. This is the first contract
          I’ve ever been on that I have had the opportunity of interacting with
          the Executives and that is because they care about my well being. All
          I can say is I am glad to be here and I look forward to bigger and
          better opportunities ahead as I grow and evolve with Recro.

          Since starting my new role nearly four months ago with Recro, my
          experience has been very positive. The transition into this position
          has been smooth, and I’ve felt well-supported by both leadership and
          my team. I’ve been able to contribute effectively while also learning
          new skills that continue to expand my professional growth. The work
          environment is collaborative, structured, and motivating, which has
          allowed me to adapt quickly and stay engaged. Overall, I have no
          complaints and I look forward to continuing to grow and add value in
          this role.

          At Recro, I’ve had the chance to do more than just build systems, I’ve
          built solutions that matter. Over nearly six years, I’ve helped
          modernize platforms for national defense, engineered secure
          cloud-native environments, and transformed legacy systems into
          scalable, reliable solutions that teams can depend on. \

          \

          What makes Recro different is the culture of growth and trust. I’ve
          been encouraged to take ownership of complex challenges, innovate with
          new technologies, and continue growing in my career. Along the way,
          I’ve earned certifications like CompTIA Cloud+ and CKA (Certified
          Kubernetes Administrator) credentials that reflect both the
          opportunities I’ve been given and the skills I’ve been able to sharpen
          here. \

          \

          And the journey doesn’t stop there. Right now, I’m diving deeper into
          Confluent, Elastic, Cribl, and Nutanix, expanding my expertise in
          observability, data streaming, and enterprise cloud platforms. Having
          the space and support to explore these tools keeps me inspired and
          ready for the next challenge.\

          \

          Recro isn’t just another company—it’s a place where your skills grow,
          your ideas matter, and your work has a real impact. That’s what makes
          being part of this team so rewarding.
